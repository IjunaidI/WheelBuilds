# CLAUDE.md — Storefront

Storefront-scoped guide. The repo-wide CLAUDE.md at the root covers backend, vendor-sync, env, and Railway specifics — read it for anything outside `storefront/`.

For visual / design rules, the canonical reference is [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md). Read it before touching JSX, CSS, or any component that renders inside the design system.

## What this storefront is

A MedusaJS 2.x Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19) storefront for **Wheel Builds** — a wheels + tires e-commerce site. The current visual layer is a custom design (garage / blueprint aesthetic, surgical orange #FF6A00, Antonio display type) ported from a Claude Design handoff. The Medusa data layer underneath is unchanged from the boilerplate.

## Design coverage

Every screen from the original Wheel Builds design bundle is built. As of Spec 1 the work is **chrome-complete and data-live**: Discovery reads from Meilisearch (vendor-sync-indexed wheel docs) and PDP reads from the Medusa Store API. Home catalog sections (NEW THIS WEEK, SHOP BY STYLE, TRUSTED BRANDS) are wired to live Meilisearch data via getHomeCatalog; FEATURED BLOCKS / BUILD GALLERY / NEWSLETTER remain editorial/placeholder. Search drawer, nav, footer, and cart were already wired against real data; Spec 2 layers on the wheel-size.com fitment join.

| Surface | Route | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home | `/` | **Shipped** | Hero + 7 sections, fully responsive |
| Nav (desktop + mobile) | (all `(main)` routes) | **Shipped** | 56px mobile utility bar + hamburger Vaul drawer; 40px desktop utility + 56px primary nav |
| Footer | (all `(main)` routes) | **Shipped** | 5-col desktop → 2-col xsmall+ → stacked mobile |
| Search drawer | `(main)/layout.tsx` mount | **Shipped** | Vaul `direction="right"`, opens via Cmd/Ctrl+K, search trigger, garage pill, hero tiles |
| Discovery (catalog) | `/store` | **Shipped (live data)** | Filter rail (Vehicle / Brand / Diameter / Bolt Pattern / Finish / Price), sort dropdown, active-filter chips, paginated grid, empty state. Mobile rail collapses to a bottom Vaul drawer with active-count badge + "View N results" footer. Data comes from a disjunctive Meilisearch `multiSearch` (one hits query + one facet query per dimension, each facet counted with the OTHER filters applied). |
| Product Detail | `/products/[handle]` | **Shipped (live data)** | Breadcrumb, hero (gallery + variant picker + purchase panel), specs grid, fitment list with active-vehicle status, related products. Reads live from the Medusa Store API; bogus handles 404 via `notFound()` propagated through `generateMetadata` + the page. |
| Mobile responsive | (all surfaces above) | **Shipped** | One `small:` breakpoint at 1024px divides mobile and desktop. Discovery rail → bottom drawer, nav → hamburger, hero headline 132→64px, grids collapse 6→2 cols, hero split → stacked, etc. |

**Out of scope** (called out in the original design bundle but skipped at project start):
- The Tweaks panel that switches between three Mood / three Accent / three Display axes. The shipped storefront bakes in **Garage mood · High accent · Wide display**; adding the other modes is a separate scoped piece of work (state plumbing + CSS variants + the panel itself).

**Engineering follow-up that doesn't affect the design contract** (see also DESIGN.md §10):
- Real product photography (every photographic element is an `<ImgPlaceholder>` today).
- PDP add-to-cart + Buy Now are wired to the cart server action (WB-001). Wishlist save is still toast-only (no wishlist backend yet).
- Phase 2.1 vehicle fitment data — Spec 1 wired the substrate (`bolt_patterns_canonical` index field + `DiscoveryQuery.vehicleConstraint` seam + the canonical bolt-pattern normalizer); Spec 2 lands the wheel-size.com client + matcher + persistent garage.

## The `.frame` wrapper rule

The new design uses a single root class `.frame` that scopes its CSS variables (`--orange`, `--ink`, `--hairline`, …) and class selectors (`.display`, `.label`, `.btn`, `.wheel`, …). It's applied **once** at [`app/[countryCode]/(main)/layout.tsx`](src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/layout.tsx). Do not re-apply `.frame` on children — they're already inside it.

`(checkout)` routes are intentionally outside `.frame`. If you ever need design tokens in checkout, either wrap that layout in `.frame` too, or hoist `.frame` to the top-level `app/layout.tsx`.

## Naming convention — no `wb-` prefix

The project name (Wheel Builds) is implied. **Never** use `wb-`, `WB`, or `wheelbuilds-` prefixes on component dirs, files, exports, or CSS classes. If a new identifier would collide with a generic name elsewhere (e.g. an existing `icon`), pick a more specific name (`inline-icon`, `product-icon`) — don't reintroduce the prefix.

Detail and examples: [memory/feedback_no_wb_prefix.md](../.claude/projects/e--medusajs-2-0-for-railway-boilerplate/memory/feedback_no_wb_prefix.md).

## Server vs client components

Default to **server components** for layouts, page templates, and anything that fetches Medusa data. Promote to `"use client"` only when you need:

- Local UI state (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`)
- Browser APIs (localStorage, window, document)
- Event handlers attached to DOM (`onClick`, `onChange`, …) on intrinsic elements
- A subscription to one of the client stores (`useGarage`, `useSearchOpen`, `useRecentSearches`)

Patterns established by this work:

- Server components compose pages and inject client "islands" where interaction is needed (e.g. [`Nav`](src/modules/layout/templates/nav/index.tsx) is a server component, but it includes [`<GaragePill />`](src/modules/layout/components/garage-pill/index.tsx) and [`<SearchTrigger />`](src/modules/search/components/search-trigger/index.tsx) which are client components).
- The home [`Hero`](src/modules/home/components/hero/index.tsx) is a client component because the vehicle tiles read from `useGarage()`; the other home sections are server components.
- Don't pass server data into a client component by serializing it through props if you can avoid it — fetch in the server parent and pass primitives.

## Data fetching

All Medusa API calls go through `lib/data/*`. Server components call those directly (they're async). Client components call them through Server Actions in `modules/<feature>/actions.ts`. Don't import the Medusa SDK directly from a component.

## Garage abstraction

`lib/garage/` defines a `GarageProvider` interface ([provider.ts](src/lib/garage/provider.ts)) and exports a singleton `garage` ([index.ts](src/lib/garage/index.ts)). Today the singleton is a `LocalStorageGarage` ([local-storage-garage.ts](src/lib/garage/local-storage-garage.ts)); when Phase 2.2 (customer-vehicle backend) lands, swap that one line to a `MedusaGarage` implementation. The `Vehicle` type already carries optional fitment fields so the type doesn't shift on swap.

Components read via the `useGarage()` hook ([use-garage.ts](src/lib/garage/use-garage.ts)). Don't read `localStorage` directly anywhere else.

The static Year/Make/Model lookup data is at [`vehicle-data.ts`](src/lib/garage/vehicle-data.ts) and gets replaced by the wheel-size.com dataset when Phase 2.1 lands.

## Client stores

Two tiny `useSyncExternalStore`-based stores live at `lib/stores/`:

- [`search-store.ts`](src/lib/stores/search-store.ts) — drawer open/closed. `openSearch()`, `closeSearch()`, `toggleSearch()`, `useSearchOpen()`.
- [`recent-searches.ts`](src/lib/stores/recent-searches.ts) — most-recent text queries (cap 10). `addRecentSearch(q)`, `clearRecentSearches()`, `useRecentSearches()`.

Same pattern (module-level state + emitter set + `useSyncExternalStore`). If you add another global piece of client UI state, follow this pattern rather than reaching for Context or Zustand — it stays zero-dependency.

## Search

- The drawer is mounted once in `(main)/layout.tsx` via [`<SearchMount />`](src/modules/search/components/search-mount/index.tsx). It wraps a [Vaul `<Drawer direction="right">`](src/components/ui/drawer.tsx) which owns Esc/overlay-click/drag-to-dismiss/scroll-lock/focus-trap/slide-animation. The only custom behavior left in SearchMount is the global `Cmd/Ctrl+K` opener.
- Triggers: the nav search icon ([`SearchTrigger`](src/modules/search/components/search-trigger/index.tsx)), the [`GaragePill`](src/modules/layout/components/garage-pill/index.tsx) in the nav, and the hero's vehicle tiles + "USE MY GARAGE" button.
- Text submit → `/<countryCode>/store?q=<encoded query>`. Discovery's server-component adapter reads `q` into Meilisearch full-text search (`searchableAttributes: title, brand, skus`). Recent-search and trending chips route the same way.
- Popular-search chips route to facet filter URL params (`?finishes=black`, `?diameters=20`) rather than free-text `q`, because chip values are facet axes. (The legacy `search()` Server Action and `SearchResultsTemplate` were retired in Task 9.)
- The Year/Make/Model pane writes the new vehicle to the garage, sets it active, then routes to `/store`. Spec 2 appends the fitment query param via `DiscoveryQuery.vehicleConstraint` — no change to [`ymm-pane.tsx`](src/modules/search/components/search-drawer/find-by-vehicle/ymm-pane.tsx) or [`garage-pane.tsx`](src/modules/search/components/search-drawer/find-by-vehicle/garage-pane.tsx) beyond appending a search-param tail.

## Fonts

Loaded via `next/font/google` in [`app/layout.tsx`](src/app/layout.tsx): Antonio (display), JetBrains Mono (technical labels), Inter (body). Each one exposes a CSS variable (`--font-antonio`, `--font-mono`, `--font-inter`) consumed by `wheel-builds.css`. Don't reach for raw Google Fonts `<link>` tags — go through `next/font` to avoid layout shift and to keep them self-hosted in build output.

## Routing — `[countryCode]` is mandatory

`src/middleware.ts` enforces a country code on every URL. Resolution order: Vercel IP header → `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION` → first region returned by the backend. In components:

- Server: get it from `params` (`{ params: Promise<{ countryCode: string }> }` in Next 15).
- Client: `const { countryCode } = useParams() as { countryCode: string }`.
- For links, use [`LocalizedClientLink`](src/modules/common/components/localized-client-link/index.tsx) — it prepends the country code automatically.
- For imperative `router.push(...)`, prepend it yourself: `router.push(`/${countryCode}/store?q=${encodeURIComponent(q)}`)`.

## Build + verification

- `next.config.js` has `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` and `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true`. Type and lint errors will **not** fail the build.
- Run `pnpm lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` separately to catch them.
- Pre-existing TS errors live in `lib/data/customer.ts`, `lib/data/collections.ts`, `lib/data/onboarding.ts`, `lib/data/orders.ts`, `modules/order/templates/order-completed-template.tsx`, `modules/products/components/product-onboarding-cta/index.tsx`, `modules/products/components/related-products/index.tsx`. They're Medusa SDK type drift — don't try to "fix" them as part of unrelated work.
- A pre-existing eslint warning lives in `modules/checkout/components/shipping-address/index.tsx`. Same advice.
- Backend must be running for `pnpm dev` to unblock (the `await-backend` shim polls port 9000). For storefront-only iteration, use `pnpm build:next` to skip the wait.

## Tailwind

Three flavors of styling coexist now; pick by where you are:

- **Legacy Medusa modules** (cart, checkout, account, products, side-menu) use Tailwind utilities exclusively. Keep using them when extending those files — don't mix in WB classes.
- **shadcn primitives** in [src/components/ui/](src/components/ui) use Tailwind utilities that resolve to the WB palette via the shadcn token aliases in `tailwind.config.js` (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, …). Don't hand-edit these files.
- **WB composed primitives** ([src/modules/common/components/](src/modules/common/components/)) and **page sections** inside `.frame` should reach for:
  1. A WB composed primitive first (`<Display>`, `<Label>`, `<SectionHeader>`, `<MicroLink>`, `<Chip>`, `<VehicleTile>`).
  2. A shadcn primitive for behavior (`<Button>`, `<Drawer>`, `<Dialog>`, `<DropdownMenu>`, `<Tooltip>`, …).
  3. The scoped CSS classes in [wheel-builds.css](src/styles/wheel-builds.css) (`.frame .display`, `.frame .vehicle-tile`, `.frame .product-card`, …) for design tokens already named there.
  4. Inline `style={...}` or Tailwind utilities for genuinely one-off layout values (specific `gap`/`padding`/`maxWidth`).

The general direction: as the codebase converges on the primitives, inline-styled sections shrink and `wheel-builds.css` becomes the foundation rather than the surface. DESIGN.md owns the visual contract that these layers all implement.

## shadcn/ui primitives

shadcn is integrated as a **headless behavior layer** — we use Radix/Vaul/cmdk-based primitives (Drawer, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, Sonner, Command, Sheet, Button) for accessibility, focus management, and motion, then skin them with the Wheel Builds palette so they read as part of the same design system.

- **Components dir:** [src/components/ui/](src/components/ui). Pulled in via `npx shadcn@2.1.8 add <component>`. We pin to 2.1.8 because newer shadcn defaults to Tailwind v4 which conflicts with our v3 + `@medusajs/ui-preset` setup.
- **Don't hand-edit `components/ui/*`** — they're meant to stay close to the canonical shadcn source so they can be re-pulled or upgraded. If something needs WB-specific behavior, build a wrapper in [modules/common/components/](src/modules/common/components/) (see next section) rather than editing the primitive in place.
- **What's wired today** (Jan 2026): Drawer (Vaul, owns the search panel), Sheet, Dialog, Popover (cart dropdown), DropdownMenu, Tooltip, Sonner, Command, Button, Accordion / Checkbox / Separator (Discovery filter rail), Skeleton (route-level loading fallbacks). Providers (`TooltipProvider`, `Toaster`) live in [(main)/layout.tsx](src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/layout.tsx).
- **Aliases:** `@/components`, `@/lib/utils`, `@/components/ui` — declared in [components.json](components.json) and resolved via the `@/*` path in [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json). Existing `@lib/*` and `@modules/*` aliases are unchanged.
- **`cn()` helper:** [src/lib/utils.ts](src/lib/utils.ts). Imported freely from both shadcn primitives and WB composed primitives (`modules/common/components/*`).
- **Token mapping:** the shadcn CSS variables (`--background`, `--primary`, `--ring`, …) are redefined in [styles/globals.css](src/styles/globals.css) to use HSL components from the WB palette in DESIGN.md. So `bg-primary` is WB orange, `bg-secondary` is WB `--soft`, `border-border` is WB `--hairline`. Don't change shadcn token names — change the values they map to.
- **`pnpm` on Windows:** `npx shadcn add <x>` will fail at the "install deps" step because pnpm isn't on PATH. Workaround: run the dep install separately (`npx -y pnpm@9.10.0 add <radix-pkg>`) and either let `shadcn add` finish writing the component file, or write it manually.
- **`--muted` is shadcn's, `--ink-soft` is ours.** WB originally had a `--muted` token (`#8A8A8E`) but shadcn's tokens own that name. WB's was renamed to `--ink-soft` so both systems coexist inside `.frame`. If you're adding a new WB token, grep `globals.css` first for collisions.
- **Portals and `.frame`:** shadcn primitives that use a portal (Drawer, Sheet, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, …) render at the body root, escaping the single `.frame` wrapper in `(main)/layout.tsx`. Their content classes already include `frame ` so WB tokens resolve. If you author a new portaled primitive in `components/ui/`, **add `frame` to the portal content's className** — DropdownMenu and Tooltip in this repo are the references.

## WB composed primitives

Sitting one layer above shadcn — and one layer below the page sections — are the WB-specific primitives in [src/modules/common/components/](src/modules/common/components/). They exist to keep recurring patterns from drifting apart visually, and to keep section files small. **If you find yourself writing the same `style={{ fontFamily: "var(--display)", fontSize: X, ... }}` block twice, the pattern probably belongs here.**

Current set:

**Typography & section structure**

- **[`Label`](src/modules/common/components/label/index.tsx)** — mono uppercase eyebrow text. Tones: `accent` (orange, default), `muted`, `ink`. Pass `bar` for an orange leading bar (hero / section eyebrows). Replaces ad-hoc `.label` / `.label-muted` plus inline mono/uppercase styles.
- **[`Display`](src/modules/common/components/display/index.tsx)** — Antonio display headline with `size` in pixels and tones `ink` / `orange` / `graphite` / `inherit`. Render-as via `as` (`h1`/`h2`/`span`/…). Replaces inline `<span className="display" style={{ fontSize: X, color: Y }}>`.
- **[`SectionHeader`](src/modules/common/components/section-header/index.tsx)** — the recurring "counter + title + description + action" row at the top of every home section. Pass only the slots you need; omitted ones collapse.
- **[`MicroLink`](src/modules/common/components/micro-link/index.tsx)** — the orange mono "VIEW ALL 08 →" / "BROWSE BRANDS →" link that ends sections. Country-scoped via `LocalizedClientLink` under the hood.

**Interactive bits**

- **[`Chip`](src/modules/common/components/chip/index.tsx)** — the small pill used for popular searches, brand chips, build chips, fitment-OK tags. Variants `soft` / `accent` / `outline`. Renders as a button when `onClick` is set, a link when `href` is set, a span when neither is set (decorative chips).
- **[`VehicleTile`](src/modules/common/components/vehicle-tile/index.tsx)** — the big YMM tile used in the hero and the drawer's YMM pane. Sizes `lg` (hero, 110px tall) and `md` (drawer-inline).

**Form primitives** (Jan 2026)

- **[`Field`](src/modules/common/components/field/index.tsx)** — label-above-control wrapper with optional helper/error text. Pass a string label to auto-wrap in `<Label tone="muted">`, or a node for full control. The label is the only required prop.
- **[`TextInput`](src/modules/common/components/text-input/index.tsx)** — WB-styled `<input>`. Sizes `default` (44px) and `lg` (56px). Distinct from the legacy [`Input`](src/modules/common/components/input/index.tsx) which is a Medusa-checkout floating-label compound — leave that one alone, it powers checkout/account.
- **[`Select`](src/modules/common/components/select/index.tsx)** — WB-styled native `<select>` with a custom chevron. Native is intentional so mobile gets the platform picker (much better UX than a Radix custom dropdown for long lists like YMM years). For combobox/searchable patterns later, use shadcn `<Command>` instead.

**Assets**

- [`Wheel`](src/modules/common/components/wheel/index.tsx), [`Icon`](src/modules/common/components/icon/index.tsx), [`Logo`](src/modules/common/components/logo/index.tsx), [`ImgPlaceholder`](src/modules/common/components/img-placeholder/index.tsx).

The pattern when extending: if a section needs interactive behavior (drawer, dropdown, popover, toast, modal) → reach into `@/components/ui/*`. If a section needs a visual pattern that more than one place uses (eyebrow label, display heading, section header, chip) → reach into `@modules/common/components/*`. Don't bake either layer into page-section code with inline styles unless the pattern is genuinely one-off.

## Discovery (catalog) page

The `/store` route is the catalog / discovery page. It lives at [`modules/discovery/`](src/modules/discovery/) and is composed from the WB primitives + shadcn primitives + a server-only Meilisearch adapter. Data is live via a disjunctive `multiSearch` adapter — one hits query + one per-dimension facet query, each facet counted with the OTHER filters applied so toggling within a dimension never collapses its own counts to zero.

Layout:

```

**Source of truth for filter state is URL search params** (`?brands=BLACKLINE+FORGED&diameters=22&sort=price-asc&page=2`). The server component re-runs whenever any param changes; client components write back via `useDiscoveryQuery` (which delegates to `router.push`). The adapter also reads `?q=<text>` into Meilisearch full-text search.

**Live wiring:**

1. One `meili.multiSearch` batch: a hits query + N facet queries (`FACET_FIELDS = [brand, diameters, bolt_patterns, finish]`), each facet query counted with the OTHER filters applied via the `buildFilters` `skip` arg so disjunctive counts stay correct within a dimension.
2. Hits → `DiscoveryProduct` via `hitToProduct` (price_min is integer cents, read directly into `priceCents`).
3. The indexed doc is produced by [`backend/src/modules/vendor-sync/search/build-search-document.ts`](../backend/src/modules/vendor-sync/search/build-search-document.ts) (per-product transformer; returns `null` for non-wheels, which `medusa-config.js` coalesces into `{id, product_type:"non-wheel"}`). Index settings — `filterableAttributes`, `sortableAttributes`, `searchableAttributes`, `displayedAttributes` — are wired in [`backend/medusa-config.js`](../backend/medusa-config.js) on the `@rokmohar/medusa-plugin-meilisearch` plugin block.
4. `vehicleConstraint?: string[]` on `DiscoveryQuery` is the Spec 2 seam — empty in Spec 1. Spec 2 appends extra Meilisearch filter clauses derived from the active vehicle's wheel-size.com spec.
5. `useDiscoveryQuery` only manipulates URL params — no change there.

`modules/store/` is **retained** (not deleted) because `SortOptions`, `RefinementList`, and `PaginatedProducts` are still imported by the categories page, collections page, `lib/data/products.ts`, `lib/util/sort-products.ts`, `modules/categories/templates`, and `modules/collections/templates`.

`TODO(integration)` comments in the rail still mark follow-ups: the Vehicle band's "only show wheels that fit" toggle is now wired for Spec 2 to feed `DiscoveryQuery.vehicleConstraint`; the Price section's TextInputs should become a `<Slider>` once a real min/max range is surfaced from Meilisearch.

## Product Detail (PDP)

The `/products/[handle]` route is the product detail page. It lives at [`modules/product-detail/`](src/modules/product-detail/) and follows the same single-adapter pattern as Discovery. Data is live from the Medusa Store API (price + stock authoritative) via `getProductByHandle`, which is `React.cache`'d so `getRelatedProducts` dedupes the lookup.

**Live wiring:**

1. `getProductDetail(handle)`: `getRegion(DEFAULT_COUNTRY)` → `getProductByHandle(handle, region.id)`. The `lib/data/products.ts` fields string now includes `+collection_id` so `getRelatedProducts` can find the brand collection.
2. `notFound()` in the adapter propagates through both `generateMetadata` and the page component — bogus handles 404 cleanly.
3. `mapToDetail`: groups variants by `${diameter}x${width}` into `sizeOptions`; sibling offsets accumulate as `offsetVariants`; availability uses best-of-siblings ranking (`in_stock` > `low_stock` > `out_of_stock`) so the size cell shows `in_stock` when ANY offset is available; `priceCentsOverride` = min non-zero across siblings. Per-offset `priceCents` on `OffsetVariant` lets the panel price the selected offset, not the size minimum.
4. `getRelatedProducts`: queries the same brand `collection_id`, capped at 6, excludes self.
5. `fitment`: `[]` (Spec 2). The Fitment section degrades gracefully on empty.
6. Specs grid: `construction` / `countryOfOrigin` / `warranty` default to `"—"` (not in vendor data — gap 4.1). `weightLb = product.weight / 453.592` (Medusa stores grams).
7. The finish normalization rule lives in the adapter as a byte-equivalent copy of [`backend/src/modules/vendor-sync/search/normalize-finish.ts`](../backend/src/modules/vendor-sync/search/normalize-finish.ts) — keep them in lockstep.
8. [`lib/fitment/canonical-bolt-pattern.ts`](src/lib/fitment/canonical-bolt-pattern.ts) is a lockstep twin of the backend [`canonicalBoltPatterns`](../backend/src/modules/vendor-sync/search/bolt-pattern-canonical.ts); the shared [`fixtures/bolt-pattern-canonical-golden.json`](../fixtures/bolt-pattern-canonical-golden.json) test guards drift — keep them in sync.

One `TODO(integration)` anchor remains in the code (Add-to-cart + Buy Now are now wired — WB-001):
- `fitment/index.tsx` — Spec 2 will replace the substring heuristic with a wheel-size.com fitment match

Save-to-wishlist on `purchase-panel.tsx` stays a plain toast (no wishlist backend yet — not tagged `TODO(integration)`).

`modules/products/` is **retained** (not deleted) because `Thumbnail` is imported by `modules/account/components/order-card`, `modules/cart/components/item`, `modules/checkout/templates/checkout-summary`, `modules/layout/components/cart-dropdown`, and `modules/order/components/item`.

## Gotchas

- **`SideMenu`** ([modules/layout/components/side-menu](src/modules/layout/components/side-menu/index.tsx)) is orphaned — the new nav uses [`MobileMenu`](src/modules/layout/components/mobile-menu/index.tsx) (Vaul drawer) instead. SideMenu still references `/search` which no longer exists. Harmless dead code — delete during a cleanup pass.
- **Cart dropdown** is on shadcn [`<Popover>`](src/components/ui/popover.tsx) (via Radix portal); the inner content uses `className="frame"` so WB tokens resolve. The dropdown trigger is a `<PopoverAnchor asChild>` wrapping the cart link, which lets the link still navigate to `/cart` on click while the panel opens on hover.
- **The cart preview's "Go to cart" button** is still the legacy `@medusajs/ui` `<Button>` (not the new shadcn `<Button>`). It's only used inside the cart-dropdown chrome; swap when convenient. Other cart/account/checkout legacy pages still use Medusa-UI components everywhere — that's intentional, they're outside `.frame`.
- **Featured-products module** has been deleted (it was dead code — never imported by the home page after the catalog-wiring refactor).
- **`(main)` layout's `.frame` applies to every page in the group**, including `/store`, `/cart`, `/products/[handle]`, etc. Those pages don't use the design classes, but they inherit `.frame`'s background (faint grid pattern on `#FAFAF8`) and base font size. If a future page needs a different chrome (e.g. a fully bleached PDP), wrap that page in a counter-class or move `.frame` to a per-page wrapper.
- **No scroll-reveal / fade-in-on-scroll animations** — they were prototyped and removed; commerce pages should be instantly scannable. Stick to the existing hover lifts on cards + the shadcn/Vaul primitive motion. If a future surface genuinely needs an entry animation (a special-edition launch hero, say), add it scoped to that one section rather than globally.
- **`/<countryCode>/results/*` now 404s.** Task 9 deleted the legacy route and Task 8 retired every internal navigation to it. External bookmarks or indexed URLs still pointing there will break — a redirect rule in `next.config.js` (`/results/:query → /store?q=:query`) would be a nice SEO guard but is intentionally out of scope for Spec 1.

## Adding new pages or sections

For a new home section:

1. Create `src/modules/home/components/<section-name>/index.tsx`.
2. Start with `<SectionHeader>` for the top row, then `<Display>` / `<Label>` / `<MicroLink>` / `<Chip>` for the inside. Reach for [`Wheel`](src/modules/common/components/wheel/index.tsx) / [`Icon`](src/modules/common/components/icon/index.tsx) / [`ImgPlaceholder`](src/modules/common/components/img-placeholder/index.tsx) for visuals.
3. Server component by default. Promote to `"use client"` only if the section reads from a client store (`useGarage`, `useSearchOpen`, …) or attaches event handlers.
4. Import it into [`app/[countryCode]/(main)/page.tsx`](src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/page.tsx) in the right order.

For a new top-level route inside the design:

1. Add the file under `src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/<route>/page.tsx`.
2. Server component; fetch from `lib/data/...`.
3. Render design-system markup from `src/modules/<feature>/components/...`, built from the primitives in `modules/common/components/`.
4. Section padding follows `DESIGN.md` conventions.

For a new interactive primitive (dialog / dropdown / popover / toast / etc.):

1. Check [`src/components/ui/`](src/components/ui) first — if shadcn already ships it, pull via `npx shadcn@2.1.8 add <name>` (or write the file directly using the canonical shadcn 2.x source if `pnpm` isn't on PATH).
2. The tokens map already gives you the WB palette for free. Don't theme the primitive in place; if you need WB-specific defaults, wrap it in `modules/common/components/<name>/`.
3. If the primitive renders into a portal, ensure its content className includes `frame ` so WB tokens resolve.

For a new visual pattern that appears in 2+ places:

1. Build it in `src/modules/common/components/<name>/`. Use the existing primitives as building blocks.
2. Embed sane WB defaults (font family, spacing, color) so callers stay terse.
3. Document it in DESIGN.md §5 (Primitives) with a usage example.

For a new design-time CSS class:

1. Only add a class if the pattern truly belongs in `wheel-builds.css` rather than a React component (rare now).
2. Scope it under a `.frame .my-class { ... }` selector — never global.
3. Document it in DESIGN.md §4 (Class catalog).
4. Use a name that describes the role, not the look. `style-tile` ✓, `big-orange-box` ✗.
